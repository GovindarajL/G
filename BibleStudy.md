- https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/women/7-reasons-to-trust-god-in-the-middle-of-your-mess.html - From this, I've learned that most of the time that trouble comes, God wants to sharpen us, mold us, and transform us into something greater. He wants us to see a side of himself that we haven't yet seen. And he wants others to see the amazing things he can do in our lives when we trust him with the mess. So we might as well respond the way he desires so we can get out of the mess, don't you think?

I love how James 1:2-3 tells us to "consider it all joy" when we encounter various trials, knowing the testing of our faith produces endurance. "And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing" (verse 4).

God can be trusted. And he wants you to know that. Lean into him during this time and you will know what it means to "find meaning in the mess."
